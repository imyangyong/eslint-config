# The filename should be blocklisted (filename-blocklist)

Allows you to blocklist certain file name patterns.

:warning: :warning: :warning:

**The rule was called `filename-blacklist` in versions below v2.0.0. This rule name has been abandoned since it is less inclusive. Please update to the latest rule name.**

## Rule Details

This rule aims to maintain a consistent naming scheme.

If the rule had been set as follows:
```js
...
'filesname/filename-blocklist': ['error', { '**/*.model.ts': '*.models.ts' }],
...
```

Examples of **incorrect** filename with path for this rule:
```sh
src/foo.model.ts
src/bar.model.ts
```

Examples of **correct** filename with path for this rule:
```sh
src/foo.models.ts
src/bar.models.ts
```

:warning: :warning: :warning:

**Versions <= v2.0.0 can only select target files by their filenames, not by their paths. This support has been deprecated and will be removed  in the future. Please select your target files by their file path. For example, using `**/*.js` instead of `*.js` to select all `js` files.**


### Options

#### blocklist pattern object

You need to specify a different naming pattern for each filename blocklist. The second pattern is used to hint at the correct file name that should be used instead. The plugin will only check blocklisted pattern you explicitly provided:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'filesname',
  ],
  rules: {
    'filesname/filename-blocklist': ['error', {
      '**/*.model.ts': '*.models.ts',
      '**/*.util.ts': '*.utils.ts',
    }],
  },
};
```
